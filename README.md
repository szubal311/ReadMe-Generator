# ReadMe-Generator

## Description
We were asked to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. 

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.
